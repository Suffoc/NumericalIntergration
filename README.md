# NumericalIntergration
This project aims to calculate Intergration numerically in several algorithm
* Compound trapezoidal
* Compound Simpson
* Romberg
* Gauss with 3 Nodes
* Gauss with 4 Nodes

We intergrate $f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ using the above 5 algorithms, and evaluate the errors and computation complexity of them.
